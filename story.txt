There once was a village idiot named Gabriel. The whole town mocked him for his severe lack of intelligence. He would roam the streets, looking for hte star student, Ivan, to copy off of. Since he was slow-witted he never had the ability to actually succeed in his academic dishonesty. Ivan would shoo away Gabriel, like he were a pigeon (who he has a smaller iQ than), and Gabriel's plan would be foiled again. Ivan, being a star student would of course go on to report Gabriel to Sherriff Moran, who would penalize Gabriel as he saw fit. One day, the charges had simply racked up and Gabriel was kicked out of the school and the town once and for all. Some say, that the mentally-lacking ghoul of Gabriel still roams the woods to this day, bumping into things constantly, and being unable to solve 2+2. Everyone else lived happily ever after, except Mr. One Braincell of course.
